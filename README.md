Simple Sides is a resource pack that streamlines the side textures of Grass, Snowy Grass, Grass Path, Podzol, Mycelium, Crimson Nylium, and Warped Nylium!

* Support for Bedrock Edition
* Support for Java Edition
* Designed to work in conjunction with all resource packs

You can share this resource pack, but please refer others to the official [MCPEDL post](https://mcpedl.com/simple-sides/), or this GitHub Repository only.

Feel free to include Simple Sides in your own resource pack! My only requests are for a mention of my username, "Offroaders123", and a link back to either this MCPEDL post, my MCPEDL profile, this GitHub Repository, or my GitHub profile. Thanks!
